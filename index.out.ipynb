    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">This research aims to demonstrate the efficacy of the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model (GLLAMM) \\[@Rabe_et_al_2004a; @Rabe_et_al_2004b; @Rabe_et_al_2004c; @Skrondal_et_al_2004a\\] in analyzing entropy scores for investigating speech intelligibility hypotheses. Using transcriptions from spontaneous speech data originally collected by @Boonen_et_al_2023, the study employs the Bayesian Beta-proportion GLLAMM to model the resulting entropy scores. The research compared the model’s prediction accuracy with the Normal Linear Mixed Model (LMM) \\[@Holmes_et_al_2019\\] and investigated its capacity to estimate a latent intelligibility from these entropy scores. The study also illustrates how researcher can explore hypotheses concerning the impact of speaker-related factors on intelligibility. Results show the superiority of the Beta-proportion GLLAMM in predicting empirical phenomena over the Normal LMM and its ability to quantify latent potential intelligibility. Additionally, the model facilitates hypothesis exploration concerning speaker-related factors and intelligibility. However, implementing these statistical tools require formulating assumptions about the data-generating process and knowledge of probabilistic programming languages, the core of Bayesian methods. Nevertheless, the study suggests future research directions, including causal hypothesis formulation and novel methods for intelligibility assessment. Ultimately, this research has implications for researchers and data analysts interested in quantitatively measuring intricate, unobservable constructs and accurately predicting empirical phenomena.</span>"

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Intelligibility is at the core of successful, felicitous communication. Thus, being able to speak intelligibly is a major achievement in language acquisition and development. Moreover, intelligibility is considered to be the most practical index to assess competence in oral communication ([Kent, Miolo, and Bloedel 1994](#ref-Kent_et_al_1994)). Consequently, it serves as a key indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of various interventions like speech therapy or cochlear implantation ([Chin, Bergeson, and Phan 2012](#ref-Chin_et_al_2012)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of speech intelligibility may appear deceptively simple, yet it is an intricate concept filled with inherent challenges in its assessment. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Intelligibility refers to the extent to which a listener can accurately recover the words in a speaker’s acoustic signal ([Freeman et al. 2017](#ref-Freeman_et_al_2017); [van Heuven 2008](#ref-vanHeuven_2008); [Whitehill and Chau 2004](#ref-Whitehill_et_al_2004)). Furthermore, achieving intelligible spoken language requires to master all core components of speech perception, cognitive processing, linguistic knowledge, and articulation ([Freeman et al. 2017](#ref-Freeman_et_al_2017)). Hence, it is unsurprising that its accurate measurement faces challenges ([Kent et al. 1989](#ref-Kent_et_al_1989)). These challenges arise from the interplay of the attributes of the communicative environment such as background noise ([Munro 1998](#ref-Munro_1998)), with features of the speaker like speaking rate ([Munro and Derwing 1998](#ref-Munro_et_al_1998)) or accent ([Jenkins 2000](#ref-Jenkins_2000); [Ockey, Papageorgiou, and French 2016](#ref-Ockey_et_al_2016)), and characteristics of the listener like vocabulary proficiency or hearing ability ([Varonis and Susan 1985](#ref-Varonis_et_al_1985))</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "While several approaches have been proposed to assess intelligibility, they commonly rely on two types of speech samples: read-aloud or imitated, and spontaneous speech samples. Most studies favor read-aloud or imitated speech samples due to the substantial control they offer in selecting stimuli for intelligibility assessment. Additionally, these types of speech facilitate a direct and unambiguous comparison between a defined word target, produced by a speaker, and the listener’s identification of it, as exemplified by multiple studies such as Castellanos et al. ([2014](#ref-Castellanos_et_al_2014)), Chin, Bergeson, and Phan ([2012](#ref-Chin_et_al_2012)), Chin and Kuhns ([2014](#ref-Chin_et_al_2014)), Freeman et al. ([2017](#ref-Freeman_et_al_2017)), Khwaileh and Flipsen ([2010](#ref-Khwaileh_et_al_2010)), and Montag et al. ([2014](#ref-Montag_et_al_2014)). However, it has been demonstrated that these controlled speech samples exhibit limited efficacy in predicting intelligibility among hearing-impaired individuals ([Cox et al. 1989](#ref-Cox_et_al_1989); [Ertmer 2011](#ref-Ertmer_2011)). <span style=\"color:blue;\">In contrast, spontaneous speech samples offer a more ecologically valid approach to assess intelligibility, resembling everyday informal speech more than read-aloud or imitated speech samples ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)). However, due to the uncertainty surrounding the speaker’s intended word production, it is unfeasible to establish a word target for these samples ([Flipsen 2006](#ref-Flipsen_2006); [Lagerberg et al. 2014](#ref-Lagerberg_et_al_2014)). This renders conventional accuracy metrics from imitated speech, such as the percentage of read or imitated words, impractical ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Yet, various metrics of intelligibility can still be derived from transcriptions of spontaneous speech samples, including the percentage of (un)intelligible words or syllables ([Flipsen 2006](#ref-Flipsen_2006); [Lagerberg et al. 2014](#ref-Lagerberg_et_al_2014)), as well as entropy scores ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)). In the latter approach, listeners transcribe orthographically spontaneous speech samples produced by various speakers.</span> These transcriptions are then aggregated into entropy scores, where lower scores indicate a higher degree of agreement among the listeners transcriptions and, consequently, higher intelligibility, while higher scores suggest lower intelligibility due to a lower degree of agreement in the transcriptions ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023); [Faes, De Maeyer, and Gillis 2022](#ref-Faes_et_al_2022)). Notably, the aggregation procedure assumes that speech samples are considered intelligible if all listeners decode them in the same manner. These scores have been instrumental in examining differences in speakers’ speech intelligibility, particularly between children with normal hearing and those with cochlear implants ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite the entropy scores’ potential as a fine-grained metric of intelligibility, as proposed by Boonen et al. ([2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)), they exhibit a statistical complexity that cautions researchers against treating them as straightforward indices of intelligibility. This complexity emerges from the processes of data collection and transcription aggregation, endowing the scores with four distinctive features: boundedness, measurement error, clustering, and the possible presence of outliers and heteroscedasticity. Firstly, entropy scores are confined to the interval between zero and one, a phenomenon known as boundedness. Boundedness refers to the restriction of data values within specific bounds or intervals, beyond which they cannot occur ([Lebl 2022](#ref-Lebl_2022)). <span style=\"color:blue;\">Secondly, entropy scores are assumed to be a manifestation of a speaker’s intelligibility, with this intelligibility being the primary factor influencing the observed scores.</span> This issue is commonly referred to as measurement error, signifying the disparity between the observed values of a variable, recorded under similar conditions, and some fixed *true value* which is not directly observable ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Thirdly, due to the repeated assessment of speakers through multiple speech samples, the scores exhibit clustering. Clustering occurs when outcomes stem from repeated measurements of the same individual, location, or time ([McElreath 2020](#ref-McElreath_2020)). <span style=\"color:blue;\">Lastly, driven by speech samples with entropy scores located at the extreme of the bounds, and the presence of more than one population in the data (i.e., normal hearing versus hearing-impaired speakers), the scores may exhibit a potential for outliers and heteroscedasticity. Outliers are observations that markedly deviate from other sample data points where they occur ([Grubbs 1969](#ref-Grubbs_1969)), while heteroscedasticity occurs when the outcome’s variance depends on the values of another variable ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to collectively address these data features can result in numerous statistical challenges that might hamper the researcher’s ability to investigate intelligibility. Notably, neglecting boundedness can, at best, lead to underfitting and, at worst, to misspecification. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Underfitting occurs when statistical models fail to capture the underlying data patterns, potentially generating predictions outside the data range, thus hindering the model’s ability to generalize when confronted with new data.</span> Conversely, misspecification, which is marked by a poor representation of relevant aspects of the true data in the model’s functional form, can lead to inconsistent and less precise parameter estimates ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Additionally, overlooking issues such as measurement error, clustering, outliers, or heteroscedasticity can lead to biased and less precise parameter estimates ([McElreath 2020](#ref-McElreath_2020)), ultimately diminishing the statistical power of models and increasing the likelihood of committing type I or type II errors when addressing research inquiries. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Type I error results when the null hypothesis is falsely rejected, while Type II error that results when the null hypothesis is falsely accepted ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational statistics and data analysis, several models have been developed to address some of these data features individually and, at times, collectively. For instance, Ferrari and Cribari-Neto ([2004](#ref-Ferrari_et_al_2004)) and Simas, Barreto-Souza, and Rocha ([2010](#ref-Simas_et_al_2010)) initially introduced and expanded beta regression models to handle outcomes constrained within the unit interval. Subsequently, Figueroa-Zúñiga, Arellano-Valle, and Ferrari ([2013](#ref-Figueroa-Zuniga_et_al_2013)) extended these models to address data clustering. Over time, beta regression models have evolved to accommodate clustering and measurement errors in covariates, as demonstrated by Carrasco, Ferrari, and Arellano-Valle ([2012](#ref-Carrasco_et_al_2012)) and Figueroa-Zúñiga et al. ([2018](#ref-Figueroa-Zuniga_et_al_2018)). Furthermore, robust versions of these models have been proposed to account for other statistical data issues, such as outliers and heteroscedasticity, as seen in Bayes, Bazán, and García ([2012](#ref-Bayes_et_al_2012)) and Figueroa-Zúñiga et al. ([2021](#ref-Figueroa-Zuniga_et_al_2021)). Robust models are a general class of statistical procedures designed to reduce the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to mild or moderate departures of the data from the model’s assumptions ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Ultimately, the work of Rabe-Hesketh and colleagues introduced the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model (GLLAMM) ([Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, and Pickles 2004a](#ref-Rabe_et_al_2004a), [2004c](#ref-Rabe_et_al_2004b), [2004b](#ref-Rabe_et_al_2004c); [Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh 2004](#ref-Skrondal_et_al_2004a)), a unified framework that can simultaneously tackle all of the aforementioned data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these models have found moderate adoption in various fields, including speech communication ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)), psychology ([Unlu and Aktas 2017](#ref-Unlu_et_al_2017)), cognition ([Verkuilen and Smithson 2013](#ref-Verkuilen_et_al_2012); [Lopes et al. 2023](#ref-Lopes_et_al_2023)), education ([Pereira et al. 2020](#ref-Pereira_et_al_2020)), health care ([Ghosh 2019](#ref-Ghosh_2019); [Kangmennaang, Siiba, and Bisung 2023](#ref-Kangmennaang_et_al_2023)), chemistry ([de Brito Trindade et al. 2021](#ref-de_Brito_et_al_2021)), and policy analysis ([Dieteren et al. 2023](#ref-Dieteren_et_al_2023); [Choi 2023](#ref-Choi_2023); [Zhang, Du, and Huang 2023](#ref-Zhang_et_al_2023)). Specifically, in the domain of speech communication, Boonen et al. ([2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)) addressed data clustering within the context of intelligibility research. Conversely, de Brito Trindade et al. ([2021](#ref-de_Brito_et_al_2021)) and Kangmennaang, Siiba, and Bisung ([2023](#ref-Kangmennaang_et_al_2023)) concentrated on tackling non-normal bounded data with measurement error in covariates, within the context of chemical reactions and health care access, respectively. Remarkably, despite these individual efforts, there is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study comprehensively addressing all of these data features in a principled way, while also transparently and systematically documenting the Bayesian estimation of the resulting statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">This study employed Bayesian procedures for three main reasons. Firstly, prior research have consistently demonstrated the superiority of Bayesian methods over frequentist methods, especially with complex and overparameterized models ([Baker 1998](#ref-Baker_1998); [Kim and Cohen 1999](#ref-Kim_et_al_1999)), such as the GLLAMM used in this study. Overparameterized models are those with more parameters than observations for estimation ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Secondly, the Bayesian approach enabled the incorporation of prior information, thereby constraining certain parameters within specified bounds. This feature addressed issues such as non-convergence or improper parameter estimation common in complex models under frequentist methods ([Martin and McDonald 1975](#ref-Martin_et_al_1975); [Seaman III, Seaman Jr., and Stamey 2011](#ref-Seaman_et_al_2011)). An example is the estimation of negative variances for random effects in hierarchical models ([Holmes, Bolin, and Kelley 2019](#ref-Holmes_et_al_2019)), a problem resolved in this study through the utilization of prior distributions. Lastly, Bayesian methods have exhibited proficiency in drawing inferences from small sample sizes ([Baldwin and Fellingham 2013](#ref-Baldwin_et_al_2013); [Lambert et al. 2006](#ref-Lambert_et_al_2005); [Depaoli 2014](#ref-Depaoli_2014)). This feature of the Bayesian methods holds relevance for this study, as it also grapples with a small sample size, where reliance on the asymptotic properties of frequentist methods may not be justified.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Considering the imperative need to comprehensively address all features of the data when investigating unobservable and complex traits, this investigation aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model (GLLAMM) in handling entropy score features when exploring research hypotheses concerning speech intelligibility. To achieve this objective, the study reexamined data originating from transcriptions of spontaneous speech samples, initially collected by Boonen et al. ([2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)). The data was aggregated into entropy scores and subjected to modelling through the Bayesian Beta-proportion GLLAMM.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">To address the primary objective, the study posed three key research questions. First, given the importance of accurate predictions in developing useful practical models and testing research hypotheses ([Shmueli and Koppius 2011](#ref-Shmueli_et_al_2012)), *Research Question 1 (RQ1)* evaluated whether the Beta-proportion GLLAMM yielded more accurate predictions than the widely used Normal Linear Mixed Model (LMM) ([Holmes, Bolin, and Kelley 2019](#ref-Holmes_et_al_2019)). Second, acknowledging that intelligibility is an unobservable, intricate concept and a key indicator of oral communication competence ([Kent, Miolo, and Bloedel 1994](#ref-Kent_et_al_1994)), *Research Question 2 (RQ2)* investigated how the proposed model can estimate speakers’ latent intelligibility from manifest entropy scores. Thirdly, recognizing that research involves developing and comparing hypotheses, *Research Question 3 (RQ3)* illustrated how these research hypotheses can be examined within the model’s framework. Specifically, RQ3 assessed the influence of speaker-related factors on the newly estimated latent intelligibility.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Ultimately, this study offers researchers studying speech intelligibility through entropy scores and those in similar or different fields facing analogous data challenges with a statistical tool that improves upon current research models. This tool assess the predictability of empirical phenomena and develops a quantitative measure for the latent variable of interest. This quantitative measure, in turn, facilitates the appropriate comparison of existing hypotheses related to the latent variable, and even encourages the formulation of new ones.</span>\n",

    "Boonen et al. ([2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)) selected $32$ speakers, comprising $16$ normal hearing children (NH) and $16$ hearing-impaired children with cochlear implants (HI/CI). At the time of the collection of the speech samples, the NH group were between $68$ and $104$ months old ($M=86.3$, $SD=9.0$), while HI/CI group were between $78$ and $98$ months old ($M=86.3$, $SD=6.7$). <span style=\"color:blue;\">All children were native speakers of Belgian Dutch.</span>\n",

    "### 2.1.2 Speech samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Boonen and colleagues selected speech samples from a large corpus of children’s spontaneously spoken speech recordings. <span style=\"color:blue;\">These recordings were made in Belgian Dutch and obtained while the children narrated a story prompted by the picture book “Frog, Where Are You?” ([Mayer 1969](#ref-Mayer_1969)) to a caregiver ‘unfamiliar with the story’. Before the actual recording, the children were allowed to skim over the booklet and examine the pictures. Prior to the selection of the samples, the recordings were orthographically transcribed using the CHAT format in the CLAN editor ([MacWhinney 2020](#ref-MacWhinney_2020)). These transcriptions were exclusively used in the selection of appropriate speech samples.</span> To ensure the quality of the selection, Boonen and colleagues excluded sentences containing syntactically ill-formed or incomplete statements, with background noise, crosstalk, long hesitations, revisions, or non-words. Finally, ten speech samples were randomly chosen for each of the $32$ selected speakers. Each of these samples comprised a single sentence with a length of three to eleven words ($M=7.1$, $SD=1.1$). The process resulted in a total of $320$ selected sentences collectively comprising $2,263$ words.\n",

    "### 2.1.3 Listeners\n",

    "### 2.1.4 Transcription task and entropy scores\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Boonen et al. ([2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)) distributed the $320$ speech samples and $105$ listeners into five blocks through random allocation. Each block comprised $21$ listeners and $64$ sentences with no overlap between the blocks. The listeners were tasked with transcribing each sentence, which were presented to them in a random order. This resulted in a total of $47,514$ transcribed words from the original $2,263$ words available in the speech samples. These orthographic transcriptions were automatically aligned with a python script ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)), at the sentence level in a column-like grid structure like the one presented in <a href=\"#tbl-alignment\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 1</a>. This alignment process was repeated for each sentence from every speaker, and the output was manually checked and adjusted (if needed) in order to appropriately align the words. For more details on the random assignment and alignment procedures refer to the original authors.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Next, the aligned transcriptions were aggregated by listener, yielding $2,2634$ entropy scores, one score per word for every sentence.</span> The entropy scores were calculated following Shannon’s formula ([1948](#ref-Shannon_1948)):\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"eq-entropy\">$$\n",

    " \\qquad(1)$$</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $H_{wsib}$ denotes the entropy scores confined to an interval between zero and one, with $w$ defining the word index, $s$ the sentence index, $i$ the speaker index, and $b$ the block index. In addition, $K$ describes the number of different word types within transcriptions, and $J$ defines the total number of word transcriptions. Notice that by design, the total number of word transcriptions $J$ corresponds with the number of listeners per block, i.e., $21$ listeners. Lastly, $p_{k} = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} 1(T_{jk}) / J$ denotes the proportion of word types within transcriptions, with $1(T_{jk})$ describing an indicator function that takes the value of one when the word type $k$ is present in the transcription $j$. See <a href=\"#sec-appA\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 6.1</a> for an example of how entropy scores are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These entropy scores served as the outcome variable, capturing agreement or disagreement among listeners’ word transcriptions. Lower scores indicated a higher degree of agreement between transcriptions and therefore higher intelligibility, while higher scores indicated lower intelligibility, due to a lower degree of agreement in the transcriptions ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023); [Faes, De Maeyer, and Gillis 2022](#ref-Faes_et_al_2022)). Furthermore, no score was excluded from the modelling process using univariate procedures, rather, the identification of highly influential observations was performed within the context of the proposed models, as recommended by McElreath ([2020](#ref-McElreath_2020)).\n",

Given the clustered nature of the data, $\\mu_{sib}$ is defined by the linear combination of individual characteristics and several random effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"eq-normal-LMM-linearpred\">$$\n",
    "\\mu_{sib} = \\alpha + \\alpha_{HS[i]} + \\beta_{A, HS[i]} (A_{i} - \\bar{A}) + u_{si} + e_{i} + a_{b}\n",
    " \\qquad(3)$$</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $HS_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ denote the hearing status and chronological age of speaker $i$, respectively. Additionally, $\\alpha$ denotes the general intercept, $\\alpha_{HS[i]}$ represents the average entropy for each hearing status group, and $\\beta_{A,HS[i]}$ denotes the evolution of the average entropy per unit of chronological age $A_{i}$ for each hearing status group. Furthermore, $u_{si}$ denotes the sentence-speaker random effects measuring the unexplained entropy variability within sentences for each speaker, $e_{i}$ denotes the speaker random effects describing the unexplained entropy variability between speakers, and $a_{b}$ denotes the block random effects assessing the unexplained variability between experimental blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several notable features of the Normal LLM can be discerned from the equations. Firstly, <a href=\"#eq-normal-LMM-likelihood\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 2</a> indicates that the variability of the average entropy at the word level can differ for each speaker, enhancing the model *robustness* to mild or moderate data departures from the normal distribution assumption, such as in the presence of heteroscedasticity or outliers. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Secondly, <a href=\"#eq-normal-LMM-linearpred\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 3</a> reveals that the model assumes that no transformation is applied to the relationship between the average entropy and the linear combination of speakers’ characteristics. This is commonly known as a direct link function. In addition, the equation indicates that chronological age is *centered* around the minimum chronological age in the sample $\\bar{A}$. The *centering* procedure prevents the interpretation of parameters outside the range of chronological ages available in the data ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Also, the equation implies the model considers separate intercept and separate age slopes for each hearing status group, i.e., $\\alpha_{HS[i]}$ and $\\beta_{A, HS[i]}$ for NH and HI/CI speakers, respectively. Lastly, the presence of a general intercept $\\alpha$ in the equation reveals that the model is overparameterized. Although the estimation of overparameterized models is only possible under Bayesian methods, their estimation does not violate any statistical principle ([McElreath 2020, 345](#ref-McElreath_2020)). In contrast, in this study, the overparameterized model facilitates: (1) the comparison between the specific parameter interpretations of the Normal LMM and the Beta-proportion GLLAMM, with $\\alpha$ serving no particular purpose in the former case, and (2) the assignment of prior distributions.</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "Several features are evident in the probabilistic representation of the model. Firstly, akin to the Normal LMM, <a href=\"#eq-beta-GLLAMM-likelihood\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 4</a> reveals that the *dispersion* of average entropy at the word level can differ for each speaker. This enhances the model’s robustness to mild or moderate data departures from the beta-proportion distribution assumption. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Secondly, in contrast with the Normal LMM, <a href=\"#eq-beta-GLLAMM-linpred\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 5</a> shows the potential intelligibility of a speaker has a negative non-linear relationship with the entropy scores. The negative relationship explicitly highlights the inverse relationship between intelligibility and entropy, while the non-linear relationship maps the unbounded linear predictor to the bounded limits of the entropy scores. Thirdly, in contrast with the Normal LMM, <a href=\"#eq-beta-GLLAMM-structural\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Equation 6</a> demonstrates that the structural parameters are interpretable in terms of the latent potential intelligibility scores, where the scale of the latent trait is set by the general intercept $\\alpha$, as it is required in latent variable models ([Depaoli 2021](#ref-Depaoli_2021)). Furthermore, the equation implies the model also considers separate intercept and separate age slopes for each hearing status group, i.e., $\\alpha_{HS[i]}$ and $\\beta_{A, HS[i]}$ for NH and HI/CI speakers, respectively. In addition, it indicates that chronological age is *centered* around the minimum chronological age in the sample $\\bar{A}$. Lastly, the equation also reveals that the intelligibility scores have two sources of unexplained variability. The term $e_{i}$ represents inherent differences in potential intelligibility among different speakers. The term $u_{i}$ assumes that different sentences measure potential intelligibility differently due to variations in word difficulties and their interplay within the sentence.</span>\n",

    "### 2.2.3 Prior distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian procedures require the incorporation of priors. Priors are probability distributions summarizing the information about known or assumed parameters prior to observing any empirical data ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Upon observing empirical data, these priors undergo updating to posterior distributions following Bayes’ rule ([Jeffreys 1998](#ref-Jeffreys_1998)). In cases requiring greater modelling flexibility, a more refined representation of the parameters’ priors can be defined in terms of hyperparameters and hyperpriors. *Hyperparameters* refer to parameters indexing a family of possible prior distributions for the original parameter, while *hyperpriors* are prior distributions for such hyperparameters ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)).\n",

    "This study evaluated the comparative predictive capabilities of both the Normal LMM and the Beta-proportion GLLAMM (RQ1) while simultaneously examined various formulations regarding how speaker-related factors influence intelligibility (RQ3). In this context, the predictive capabilities of the models were intricately connected to these formulations. As a result, the study required fitting $12$ different models, each representing a specific manner to investigate one or both research questions. The models comprised six versions of both the Normal LMM and the Beta-proportion GLLAMM. The differences among the models hinged on (1) whether they addressed data clustering in conjunction with measurement error, denoted as the model type, (2) the assumed distribution for the entropy scores, which aimed to handle boundedness, (3) whether the model incorporated a robust feature to address mild or moderate departures of the data from distributional assumptions, and (4) the inclusion or exclusion of speaker-related factors in the models.

    "\n",
    "The models were estimated using `R` version 4.2.2 ([R Core Team 2015](#ref-R_2015)) and `Stan` version 2.26.1 ([Stan Development Team. 2021](#ref-Stan_2020)). Four Markov chains were implemented for each parameter, each with distinct starting values. Each chain underwent $4,000$ iterations, where the first $2,000$ serving as a warm-up phase and the remaining $2,000$ were considered samples from the posterior distribution. Verification of stationarity, convergence, and mixing for the parameter chains involved graphical analysis and diagnostic statistics. Graphical analysis utilized trace, trace-rank, and autocorrelation plots (ACF). Diagnostic statistics included the *potential scale reduction factor statistics* $\\widehat{\\text{R}}$ with a cut-off value of $1.05$ ([Vehtari et al. 2021](#ref-Vehtari_et_al_2021)). Furthermore, to confirm whether the parameters posterior distributions were generated with a sufficient number of uncorrelated sampling points, each posterior distribution density plot was inspected along with their effective sample size statistics $n_{\\text{eff}}$ ([Gelman et al. 2014](#ref-Gelman_et_al_2014)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, both graphical analysis and diagnostic statistics indicated that all chains exhibited low to moderate autocorrelation, explored the parameter space in a seemingly random manner, and converged to a constant mean and variance in their post-warm-up phase. Moreover, the density plots and statistics collectively confirmed that all posterior distributions were unimodal distributions with values centered around a mean, generated with a satisfactory number of uncorrelated sampling points, making substantive sense compared to the models’ prior beliefs. The trace, trace-rank, ACF, and distribution density plots, along with $\\widehat{\\text{R}}$ and $n_{\\text{eff}}$ statistics, are provided in the accompanying digital walk-through document for reader inspection (see <a href=\"#sec-M-SM-OS\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2.3</a> Open Science Statement).\n",

    "### 2.2.6 Model comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">This study compared the fitted models using three criteria: the deviance information criterion (`DIC`) introduced by Spiegelhalter et al. ([2002](#ref-Spiegelhalter_et_al_2002)), the widely applicable information criterion (`WAIC`) proposed by Watanabe ([2013](#ref-Watanabe_2013)), and the Pareto Smoothing Importance Sampling criterion (`PSIS`) developed by Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry ([2017](#ref-Vehtari_et_al_2017)). These criteria score models in terms of deviations from *perfect* predictive accuracy, with smaller values indicating less deviation ([McElreath 2020](#ref-McElreath_2020)). Deviations from *perfect* predictive accuracy serve as the closest estimate for the Kullback-Leibler divergence ([Kullback and Leibler 1951](#ref-Kullback_et_al_1951)), which measures the degree to which a probabilistic model accurately represents the *true* distribution of the data. Specifically, `DIC` measures in-sample deviations, while `WAIC` and `PSIS` offer an approximate measure of out-of-sample deviations.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">`WAIC` and `PSIS` are regarded as full Bayesian criteria because they encompass all the information contained in the parameter’s posterior distribution, effectively integrating and reporting the inherent uncertainty in predictive accuracy estimates. In addition to predictive accuracy, `PSIS` offers an extra benefit by identifying highly influential data points. To achieve this, the criterion employs a built-in warning system that flags observations that make out-of-sample predictions unreliable. The rationale is that observations that are relatively unlikely, according to the model, exert more influence and render predictions less reliable compared to those that are relatively expected ([McElreath 2020](#ref-McElreath_2020)).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">However, since researchers are mostly interested in comparing candidate models, it is the distance between the models that is useful, rather than the absolute value of the criteria (see [McElreath 2020, 209, 223–24](#ref-McElreath_2020)). Therefore, this study utilized the differences in `WAIC` and `PSIS` (`dWAIC` and `dPSIS`, respectively) to evaluate how distinct our probabilistic models are from each other, and which one is closer to the *true* distribution of the data. Additionally, while `DIC`, `WAIC` and `PSIS` provide *approximately correct* estimates for the expected accuracy, the criteria are also subject to uncertainty due to the specific sample over which they are computed (see [McElreath 2020, 223](#ref-McElreath_2020)). Thus, this uncertainty should also be taken into account for the criteria and their comparisons. Consequently, this study also presented the associated uncertainty for both criteria calculated as `WAIC` $\\pm 1 \\cdot$`SE`, `PSIS` $\\pm 1 \\cdot$`SE`, `dWAIC` $\\pm 1 \\cdot$`dSE` and `dPSIS` $\\pm 1 \\cdot$`dSE`. Lastly, this research also reported the models’ complexity penalization, as well as their associated weight of evidence. The complexity penalization values `pWAIC` and `pPSIS` are roughly associated with the models’ number of parameters, while the `weight` of evidence summarizes the relative support for each model.</span>\n",

    "This research question evaluated the effectiveness of the Beta-proportion GLLAMM in handling the features of entropy scores by comparing its predictive accuracy to the Normal LMM. Models $1$, $4$, $7$, and $10$ were specifically chosen for this comparison because their assumptions exclusively addressed the features of the scores, without integrating additional covariate information. As detailed in <a href=\"#tbl-fitted\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 2</a>, Model $1$ was a Normal LMM that solely addresses data clustering. Building upon this, Model $4$ introduced a robust feature.

    "## 3.3 Testing the influence of speaker-related factors on intelligibility (RQ3)\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">This research question illustrated how hypotheses on intelligibility can be examined within the model’s framework.</span> Specifically, the focus centered on assessing the influence of speaker-related factors on intelligibility, such as chronological age and hearing status. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Notably, despite RQ1 indicating the suitability of the Beta-proportion GLLAMM for entropy scores, existing statistical literature suggests that, in certain scenarios, models incorporating covariate adjustment exhibit robustness to misspecification in the functional form of the covariate-outcome relationship ([Tackney et al. 2023](#ref-Tackney_et_al_2023)). Consequently, this study compared all models detailed in Table 2. These models were characterized by different covariate adjustments on entropy scores or the latent potential intelligibility of speakers, namely chronological age and hearing status. Furthermore, some models like the Normal LMMs, potentially exhibited misspecification in the covariate-outcome relationship.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to RQ1, all criteria consistently identified the Beta-proportion GLLAMM outlined in models $11$, $12$ and $10$ as the most plausible models for the data. The models exhibited the lowest values for both `WAIC` and `PSIS`, establishing them as the least deviating models among those under comparison. In addition, <a href=\"#fig-rq3-waic-psis\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 5</a> depicts the non-overlapping uncertainty for the models’ `dWAIC` and `dPSIS` values with horizontal blue lines. This reveals that, when compared to Model $11$, most models exhibited significantly distinct predictive capabilities. Models $12$ and $10$, however, stood out as exceptions to this pattern. This observation suggests that Models $11$, $12$, and $10$ displayed the least deviation from *perfect* predictive accuracy in contrast to the other models. Lastly, the `weight` of evidence in Tables <a href=\"#tbl-rq3-waic\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 10</a> and <a href=\"#tbl-rq3-psis\" class=\"quarto-xref\">11</a>, underscored that Model $11$ accumulated the greatest support, followed by Model $12$, and lastly, by Model $10$."

    "A closer examination of two models within this comparison set reveals the reasons behind the largest observed disparities. The Normal LMM, as outlined in Model $6$, continueed to face challenges in capturing underlying data patterns, resulting in predictions that are physically inconsistent, falling outside the outcome’s range. Additionally, the model persisted in identifying highly unlikely and influential observations, making it inherently unreliable. In contrast, the Beta-proportion GLLAMM described by Model $12$ appeared to be less susceptible to extreme scores, effectively capturing data patterns within the expected data range and thereby instilling greater confidence in the reliability of the model’s estimates. This contrast is visually depicted in <a href=\"#fig-rq3-pred-speaker\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 12</a>, <a href=\"#fig-rq3-pred-speaker_model06\" class=\"quarto-xref\">13</a>, <a href=\"#fig-rq3-pred-speaker_model12\" class=\"quarto-xref\">14</a>, and <a href=\"#fig-rq3-model-outliers\" class=\"quarto-xref\">15</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the results in <a href=\"#fig-rq3-waic-psis\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 5</a>, the model comparisons favored three distinct models: Model $10$, $11$ and $12$. Model $10$, supported by $20.4\\%$ of the evidence, estimated a single intercept $\\alpha$ and no slope to explain the potential intelligibility of speakers (see <a href=\"#tbl-parameter-model10\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 5</a>). In contrast, supported by $45.1\\%$ of the evidence, Model $11$ in <a href=\"#tbl-parameter-model11\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 6</a> estimated distinct intercepts for each hearing status group, namely $\\alpha_{HS[1]}$ for NH speakers and $\\alpha_{HS[2]}$ for the HI/CI counterparts, while maintaining a single slope that gauges the impact of age on potential intelligibility estimates. The $95\\%$ HPDI for the comparison of intercepts $\\alpha_{HS[2]}-\\alpha_{HS[1]}$ revealed significant differences between NH and HI/CI speakers. Lastly, with evidence of $34.1\\%$, Model $12$ in <a href=\"#tbl-parameter-model12\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 7</a> estimated different intercepts and slopes per hearing status group, namely $\\alpha_{HS[1]}$ and $\\beta_{A,HS[1]}$ for the NH speakers, and $\\alpha_{HS[2]}$ and $\\beta_{A,HS[2]}$ for the HI/CI counterparts. The $95\\%$ HPDI for the comparison of intercepts and slopes revealed significant differences solely in the slopes between NH and their HI/CI counterparts ($\\beta_{A,HS[2]}-\\beta_{A,HS[1]}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a discerning reader can notice that these models yielded conflicting conclusions regarding the influence of chronological age and hearing status on intelligibility. Model $10$ implied no influence of chronological age and hearing status on the potential intelligibility of speakers. <a href=\"#fig-rq3-intelligibility-model10\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 6</a>, however, revealed the reason for the model’s low support. Model $10$ failed to capture the prevalent increasing age pattern observed in potential intelligibility estimates. In contrast, Model $11$ identified significant differences in potential intelligibility between NH and HI/CI speakers. The model further suggested that with the progression of chronological age, HI/CI speakers lag behind in intelligibility development, with no opportunity to catch up to their NH counterparts within the analyzed age range, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig-rq3-intelligibility-model11\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 7</a>. Finally, Model $12$ indicated no significant differences in intelligibility between NH and HI/CI speakers at $68$ months of age (around $6$ years old). However, the model revealed distinct evolution patterns of intelligibility per unit of chronological age between different hearing status groups, with HI/CI speakers displaying a slower rate of development compared to their NH counterparts within the analyzed age range. The latter is evident in <a href=\"#fig-rq3-intelligibility-model12\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 8</a>."

    "## 4.1 Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">This study examined the suitability of the Bayesian Beta-proportion GLLAMM for the quantitative measuring and testing of research hypotheses related to speech intelligibility using entropy scores.</span> The initial findings supported the assertion that Beta-proportion GLLAMMs consistently outperformed Normal LMMs in predicting entropy scores, underscoring its superior predictive performance. The results emphasized that models neglecting the outcomes’ measurement error and boundedness lead to underfitting and misspecification issues, even when robust features are integrated. This is clearly illustrated by the Normal LMMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the study showcased the Beta-proportion GLLAMM’s proficiency in estimating the latent potential intelligibility of speakers based on manifest entropy scores. Implemented under Bayesian procedures, the proposed model offered a valuable advantage over frequentist methods by further providing the full posterior distribution of the speakers’ potential intelligibility. This provision facilitated the calculation of summaries, aiding individual rankings, and supported the comparisons among selected speakers. In both scenarios, the proposed model accounted for the inherent uncertainty in the intelligibility estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, the study illustrated how the proposed model assessed the impact of speaker-related factors on potential intelligibility. <span style=\"color:blue;\">The results suggested that multiple models were plausible for the observed entropy scores, indicating that different speaker-related factor hypotheses were viable for the data, with some presenting contradictory conclusions about the influence of those factors on intelligibility.</span> However, even when unequivocal support for one hypothesis was not possible, the divided support among these models informed that certain statistical issues may be hindering the model’s ability to distinguish among individuals and, ultimately, among models. These issues encompassed the insufficient sample size of speakers, the inadequate representation of the population of speakers, and the imprecise measurement of the latent variable of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this study introduced researchers to innovative statistical tools that enhanced existing research models. <span style=\"color:blue;\">These tools not only assessed the predictability of empirical phenomena but also quantitatively measured the latent trait of interest, namely potential intelligibility, facilitating the comparison of research hypotheses related to this trait.</span> However, the presented tools introduce new challenges for researchers seeking their implementation. These challenges emerge from two distinct aspects: one methodological and the other practical. In the methodological domain, researchers need familiarity with Bayesian methods and the principled formulation of assumptions regarding the data-generating process and research inquiries. This entails understanding and addressing each of the data and research challenges within the context of a statistical (probabilistic) model. Conversely, in the practical domain, researchers need familiarity with probabilistic programming languages (PPLs), which are designed for specifying and obtaining inferences from probabilistic models -the core of Bayesian methods. To ensure the successful utilization of this new statistical tool, this study addresses both challenges by providing comprehensive, step-by-step guidance in the form of a digital walk-through document (see <a href=\"#sec-M-SM-OS\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2.3</a> Open Science Statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Limitations and further research\n",
    "\n",
    "This study provides valuable insights into the use of a novel approach to simultaneously address the different data features of entropy scores in speech intelligibility research. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study and explore potential avenues for future research. Firstly, the study interprets potential intelligibility as an unobserved latent trait of speakers influencing the likelihood of observing a set of entropy scores. These scores, in turn, reflect the transcribers’ ability to decode words in sentences produced by the same speakers. Despite this practical approach, the construct validity of the latent trait heavily depends on the listeners’ appropriate understanding and execution of the transcription task. Construct validity, as defined by Cronbach and Meehl ([1955](#ref-Cronbach_et_al_1955)), refers to the extent to which a set of manifest variables accurately represents a concept that cannot be directly measured. Considering the study assumes the transcription task set by Boonen et al. ([2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)) was properly understood and executed, it expects that potential intelligibility reflects the overall speech intelligibility of speakers. However, the study does not delve into the general epistemological considerations regarding the connection between the latent variable and the concept."

Further research is needed for finding fruitful ways to refine the measure by taking into account the (linguistic) distance between different transcriptions. -->"

    "Secondly, the study revealed a notable lack of unequivocal support for one of the models among the compared set. This outcome may be attributed to factors such as the insufficient sample size of speakers, the inadequate representation of the populations of speakers (referred to as selection bias), and the imprecise measurement of the latent variable. Small sample size and selection bias yield data with limited outcome and covariates ranges, leading to biased and imprecise parameter estimates ([Everitt and Skrondal 2010](#ref-Everitt_et_al_2010)). Moreover, fueled by the reduced measurement precision, these issues can result in models with diminished statistical power and a higher risk of type I or type II errors ([McElreath 2020](#ref-McElreath_2020)). <span style=\"color:blue;\">Consequently, future research should consider extending this study by conducting formal sample size planning. This entails assessing the impact of expanding the speakers’ pool on testing research hypotheses or increasing the number of speech samples, transcriptions, and listeners to enhance the precision of the potential intelligibility estimates. With these insights, future investigations could contemplate increasing the speaker sample with a group that adequately represents the population of interest.</span> However, this must be done while mindful of the pragmatic limitations associated with transcription tasks, specifically considering the costs and time-intensiveness of the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Thirdly, the study presented an illustrative example for the investigation of research hypotheses within the model’s framework.</span> However, it did not offer an exhaustive evaluation of all factors influencing intelligibility, which are thoroughly explored in the works of Niparko et al. ([2010](#ref-Niparko_et_al_2010)), Boons et al. ([2012](#ref-Boons_et_al_2012)), Gillis ([2018](#ref-Gillis_2018)), and Fagan, Eisenberg, and Johnson ([2020](#ref-Fagan_et_al_2020)). Consequently, the study cannot discard the presence of unobservable variables that might bias the parameter estimates, potentially impacting the inferences provided. Hence, future research should consider integrating appropriate causal hypotheses about these factors into the proposed models, as proper covariate adjustment facilitates the production of unbiased and precise parameter estimates ([Cinelli, Forney, and Pearl 2022](#ref-Cinelli_et_al_2021); [Deffner, Rohrer, and McElreath 2022](#ref-Deffner_et_al_2022)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this study proposes two directions for future exploration in speech intelligibility research. Firstly, there is an opportunity to investigate alternative methods for assessing speech intelligibility beyond transcription tasks and entropy scores. The experimental design of transcription tasks imply that the procedure may be time-intensive and costly. Thus, exploring less time-intensive or more cost-effective procedures, that still offer comparable precision in intelligibility estimates, could benefit both researchers and speech therapists alike. An illustrative example of such a method is Comparative Judgment (CJ), where judges compare and score the perceived intensity of a trait between two stimuli ([Thurstone 1927](#ref-Thurstone_1927)). In the context of the intelligibility trait, the stimuli under assessment could be the speech samples uttered by two speakers. Nevertheless, CJ serve as an ideal example as the method has gained increasing attention within the realm of educational assessment, with several studies providing evidence for its validity in assessing various task within student works, as demonstrated by examples in Pollitt ([2012a](#ref-Pollitt_2012a)); Pollitt ([2012b](#ref-Pollitt_2012b)), Lesterhuis ([2018](#ref-Lesterhuis_2018)), van Daal ([2020](#ref-vanDaal_2020)), and Verhavert et al. ([2019](#ref-Verhavert_et_al_2019)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a second avenue for exploration involves integrating diverse data types and evaluation methods to assess individuals’ intelligibility. This can be accomplished by leveraging two features of Bayesian methods: their flexibility and the concept of Bayesian updating. Bayesian methods possess the flexibility to simultaneously handle various data types. Additionally, through Bayesian updating, researchers can integrate information from the posterior distribution of parameters as priors in models for subsequent evaluations. Ultimately, this could enable researchers to assess speakers’ intelligibility progress without committing to a specific data type or evaluation method. This advancement could mirror the emergence of second-generation Structural Equation Models proposed by Muthén ([2001](#ref-Muthen_2001)), where models facilitate the combined estimation of categorical and continuous latent variables. However, in the context of future research, the proposal would facilitate the estimation of latent variables using a combination of data types and evaluation methods, contingent upon the fulfillment of construct validity by those evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This study highlights the effectiveness of the Bayesian Beta-proportion GLLAMM to collectively address several key data features when investigating unobservable and complex traits, using speech intelligibility and entropy scores as an example. The results demonstrate the proposed model consistently outperforms the Normal LMM in predicting the empirical phenomena. Moreover, it exhibits the ability to quantify the latent potential intelligibility of speakers, allowing for the ranking and comparison of individuals based on the latent trait while accommodating associated uncertainties. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Additionally, the proposed model facilitates the exploration of research hypotheses concerning the influence of speaker-related factors on potential intelligibility. The study indicates that integrating and comparing these hypotheses within the model’s framework is a straightforward task.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the introduction of these innovative statistical tools presents new challenges for researchers seeking implementation. These challenges encompass the principled formulation of assumptions about the data-generating processes and research inquiries, along with the need for familiarity with probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) essential for implementing Bayesian methods. <span style=\"color:blue;\">Nevertheless, the study suggests several promising avenues for future research, including causal hypothesis formulation, and exploration and integration of novel evaluation methods for assessing intelligibility. The insights derived from this study hold implications for both researchers and data analysts interested in quantitatively measuring intricate, unobservable constructs and accurately predicting empirical phenomena.</span>\n",

    "## 6.1 Entropy scores calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section exemplifies the entropy calculation procedure. <span style=\"color:blue;\">For that purpose, the words in position two, three, four and five observed in <a href=\"#tbl-alignment\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 1</a> were used. These words were assumed present in the first sentence, produced by the first speaker assigned to the first block, and transcribed by five listeners ($w=\\{2,3,4,5\\}$, $s=1$, $i=1$, $b=1$, $J=5$). For second word, the first four listeners identified the word type *jongen* $(T_{j1})$, while the last identified the word type *hond* $(T_{j2})$. Therefore, two word types were identified ($K=2$), with proportions equal to $\\{ p_{1}, p_{2} \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 4/5, 1/5 \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 0.8, 0.2 \\}$, and entropy score equal to:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "H_{2111} = \\frac{ -\\left[ 0.8 \\cdot log_{2}(0.8) + 0.2 \\cdot log_{2}(0.2) \\right] }{ log_{2}(5)} \\approx 0.3109\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">For the fourth word, two listeners identified the word type *een* $(T_{j1})$, one listener the word type *de* $(T_{j2})$, and another the word *geen* $(T_{j3})$.</span> A blank space *\\[B\\]* is a symbol that defines the absence of a word in a space where a word is expected, as compared with other transcriptions, during the alignment procedure. Notice that for calculation purposes, because the blank space is not expected in such position, this is considered as a different word type. Consequently four word types were registered ($K=4$), with proportions equal to $\\{ p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4} \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 2/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5 \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 \\}$ and entropy score equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "H_{4111} = \\frac{ -\\left[ 0.4 \\cdot log_{2}(0.4) + 3 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot log_{2}(0.2) \\right] }{ log_{2}(5)} \\approx 0.8277\n",
    "$$ <span style=\"color:blue;\">For the fifth word, each listener transcribed a different word.</span> It is important to highlight that when a listener does not identify a complete word, or part of it, (s)he is instructed to write *\\[X\\]* in that position. However, for the calculation of the entropy score, if more than one listener marks an unidentifiable word with *\\[X\\]*, each one of them is considered a different word type. This is done to avoid the artificial reduction of the entropy score, as *\\[X\\]* values already indicate the word’s lack of intelligibility. . Consequently, five word types were observed, $T_{j1}=$*kikker*, $T_{j2}=$*\\[X\\]*, $T_{j3}=$*kokkin*, $T_{j4}=$*kikkers*, $T_{j5}=$*\\[X\\]* ($K=5$), with proportions equal to $\\{ p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5} \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5 \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 \\}$, and entropy score equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "H_{5111} = \\frac{ -\\left[ 5 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot log_{2}(0.2) \\right] }{ log_{2}(5)} = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Lastly, for the third word, the first two listeners identified the word type *ziet* $(T_{j1})$, the next two listeners identified the word type *zag* $(T_{j2})$, while the last one identified the word type *zoekt* $(T_{j3})$. Consequently, three word types were identified ($K=3$), with proportions equal to $\\{ p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3} \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 2/5, 2/5, 1/5 \\}$ $=$ $\\{ 0.4, 0.4, 0.2 \\}$, and entropy score equal to:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{2111} = \\frac{ -\\left[ 2 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot log_{2}(0.4) + 0.2 \\cdot log_{2}(0.2) \\right] }{ log_{2}(5)} \\approx 0.6555\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue;\">Importantly, this last example showcases the major difference between entropy and measures of accuracy based on the percentage of (un)intelligible words: entropy scores employ all word type proportions in their calculations, effectively capturing the agreement and disagreement among listeners’ word transcriptions ([Boonen et al. 2023](#ref-Boonen_et_al_2023)). In contrast, the percentage of (un)intelligible words mostly discards some word type proportions in favor of *simpler* agreement or disagreement percentages. For example, an agreement percentage could be reflected by the proportion of the most frequent word, i.e., $\\text{max}\\{ 0.4, 0.4, 0.2 \\}=0.4$, or by other similar percentages detailed in the works of Flipsen ([2006](#ref-Flipsen_2006)) and Lagerberg et al. ([2014](#ref-Lagerberg_et_al_2014)).</span>\n",
